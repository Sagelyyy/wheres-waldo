Wheres Waldo is my first full stack project I made using react and firebase. You search for three characters in the image, Waldo, Odlaw and the wizard. When you find all three you are able to submit your time to a leaderboard.

## What did I learn anyway? ðŸ“š

This was my first time working with a database. I learned how to set up a firebase app, and get it integrated into my front end.
